        Some minor POD changes to make pod2man happy
        (suggested by Sebastian Bazley)

-----   2 Jan 2001     lane@duphy4.physics.drexel.edu
        Perl complained about escaping underscore in regex,
        so removed backslash

-----   17 May 2000     lane@duphy4.physics.drexel.edu
        problems when more than 7 directories in the "rooted"
        directory...had thought the limit was 8! Fixed.

-----   12 May 2000     lane@duphy4.physics.drexel.edu
        had a test error when there's a "$" in device name; needed
        to have it backslash escaped.

-----   30 Mar 2000     lane@duphy4.physics.drexel.edu
        add O_VMS option to VMS::FileUtils::Root::rooted and ::unrooted

-----   23 Mar 2000     lane@duphy4.physics.drexel.edu
        move SafeName stuff into VMS::FileUtils::SafeName, drop
        "munge/unmunge" and add "safe_archive" instead,
        for near-equivalent functionality

-----   18 Mar 2000     lane@duphy4.physics.drexel.edu
        VMS::FileUtils::Root stuff written, use internal
        Unix->VMS conversion since any SYS$PARSE calls
        with more than 8 levels will fail.

-----   11 Mar 1998     lane@duphy4.physics.drexel.edu
        add safepath and unsafepath, add :all tag to Exports

-----   10 Mar 1998     lane@duphy4.physics.drexel.edu
        initial version 0.01
