This is the README file VMS::FileUtils, which contains routines for
    VMS::FileUtils::SafeName
and VMS::FileUtils::Root

The VMS::FileUtils::SafeName module contains utilities for converting
filenames and paths into "vms-safe" form.  The conversion is
reversible, and is used by NFS software (UCX and Multinet) when
dealing with cross-platform NFS service.

In addition a (non-reversible) converter for archive filenames into
a VMS-acceptable form is also provided; this is primarily of use for
things like CPAN archive names, converting "HTML-Parser-1.07.tar.gz"
into "HTML-Parser-1_07.tar-gz".

The VMS::FileUtils::Root utilities are for using "rooted logicals"
($ define/trans=conceal  myroot  disk$here:[dir1.dir2.])
to evade the RMS's depth limitation of 8 directories.  It's an
object-oriented syntax.

Current version is 0.01.
